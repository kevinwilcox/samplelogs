createProxyLogs.sh creates a log file, exampleLogs.log, that looks a little like a web proxy log and is written in bash

createLogs.py creates a log file, proxy.log, that looks a little like a web proxy log and is written in python. This will eventually create additional log types.

Neither of these scripts has an error code, HTTP action type, complete URL, etc., in their proxy type. They simply write:

o a timestamp
o an internal IP address
o an authenticated username
o a requested URI
